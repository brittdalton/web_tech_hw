#### Begin to use JavaScript by executing statements with console.log ####


##### What steps did you take to complete the assignment? #####
1. Design Layout
2. Formatted design around focus areas
3. Responsive Web Design
4. Parallax Scrolling
5. Write content - consulting website
6. Added links for HW to the main page website

##### Executing First Statement with Command Line #####
1. Enable developer tools in browser
2. Access the Console
3. Create .html file
3. Type the following: Console.log("Hello World")
4. Verify the statement was executed via the web console


###### Executing Statements ######
>Console.log() is a statement that uses a function, this statement prints directly to the JS web console. Within the Console.log function we placed a string as the sole input "Hello World". A string is any set of text including letters, numbers and special characters. Strings can be surrounded by single quotation marks '' or double quotation marks ""


###### Bindings ######

**let**
**var**
**const**  (unchangeable)

>The script tag <script> </script> allows you to use JavaScript directly in your html file or to link the location of the script.js file to your html page.
Using linked files will increase processing time for your website but your code will be cleaner if separated from the html file and after the JS files have been cached by the computer it will help reduce excess load time.
