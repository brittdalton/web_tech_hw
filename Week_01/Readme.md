###### Markdown ######
>A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. Markup languages tend to encourage writers to focus on content and structure before concerning themselves with presentation. Structure is defined for a processor through the use of tags embedded directly in the text.
